# Daily Jar

A simple notebook for people who love saving money. Tap a day, choose Deposit or Withdraw, type the amount, add a note, save. The app records the date and time (CE years).

- Savings balance, calendar with each day's net amount, full history with notes
- Back up / restore, export CSV, English and Thai
- No account, no login, AdMob banner in the Android app only (test ads until real IDs are put in www/ads-config.json). Data stays on the phone (each device has its own).

Daily Jar is not a bank and does not hold or move real money. It only records numbers you type.
